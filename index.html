                     <div class="exmp">
                       <p class="sp2" id="ma2">1. Macroeconomics deals with the entire economy of a country and microeconomics deals with individual sectors/households in a country. The prefix "macro" means big and "micro" means small. </p>
                       <p class="sp2" id="ma3" >2. In Macroeconomics, the primary focus is on Economic Growth(producing more goods than the previous year and offering more services than the previous year) , Inflation and Unemployment. The goal here is to Maximize economic growth, Minimize unemployment and prevent inflation from increasing beyond expected rate, which is usually between 2% and 6%.<p> 
                       <p class="sp2" id="ma4">3.There are two economic policies that are used to achieve our economic goals. They are Fiscal policy and Monetary policy. Fiscal policy primarily deals with taxation. Monetary policy deals with regulating money supply in the economy. Central government deals with Fiscal Policy. Central bank deals with Monetary policy. In india it is called Reserve Bank Of India (RBI), in america it is called the Federal Reserve. Central government levies taxes, while the central bank is the head of all banks in a country and regulates money supply using various interest rates.</p>
                       <p class="sp2" id="ma5">4. If you type " Milton Friedman - I, pencil " on youtube, you will get a video in which he explained briliantly how foreign trade works. It is a must watch video. <p>

                     <div class="exmp">
                       <p class="sp2" id="ma2">1. Microorganisms are the living organisms too small to be seen with the naked eye. They are broadly classified into four main groups, namely Bacteria ,Viruses , Parasites and Fungi. While the majority of them are harmless,some of them can cause serious infections. </p>

                       <p class="sp2" id="ma3">2. In 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin by accident. He observed that the mold (fungus) that had been accumulating on his petri dish killed the surrounding bacteria by secreting a substance as a protection mechanism. Fleming called it "penicillin." Later, scientists figured out a way to separate penicillin and mass-produce it.</p>

                       <p class="sp2" id="ma4">3. Penicillin was the first antibacterial drug. By the 1970s, other drugs, like the first antiviral, antifungal, and antiparasitic drugs, had been discovered. An antibacterial drug cannot work on infections caused by viruses. That's why an antibacterial drug cannot cure a cold; It's caused by a virus, not bacteria.</p>

                       <p class="sp2" id="ma5">4. Over a period of decades, microorganisms are developing resistance to these drugs because of random mutations or natural selection. This could reduce the effectiveness of the drugs currently used to treat the infections caused by these microorganisms. This condition is called antimicrobial resistance. The over-prescribing of antibiotics has contributed to this problem, and scientists are trying to solve it.</p>

                    <div>
                      <p class="sp1" id="ma6">The idea that history is the best predictor of the future may not be 100% accurate, but it holds a lot of weight. Learning famous proverbs and sayings may be a better way of learning both history and English grammar. While the majority of these quotes can't be traced to their exact sources, many can be correctly attributed; we will discuss both types. </p>

                      <p class="sp1" id="ma7">The two important poems that everyone should read are "First they came..." by German pastor Martin Niemöller , and "A Worker Reads History" by Bertolt Brecht.
